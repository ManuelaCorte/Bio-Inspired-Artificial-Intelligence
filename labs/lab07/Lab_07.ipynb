    "\n",
    "## Traveling Salesman Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)$^{[1]}$, a salesperson is expected to make a round trip visiting a set of $N$ cities, returning the starting city. The goal is to minimize the total distance traveled. In the simplest version of the TSP, that we consider in this exercise, it is assumed that it is possible to travel from any city $i$ to any city $j$ (i.e., cities form a fully-connected graph), and the distance is the same both ways.\n",
    "To specify a TSP instance, we need the spatial coordinates $(x, y)$ for each of the $N$ cities, and an adjacency matrix $(N × N)$ describing the pairwise distances between cities. These can be computed as Euclidean distances between cities, or in general can be specified according to a given distance function (which may take into account travel cost, time, and other factors). Candidate solutions for the TSP can be easily represented as permutations of the list of city indices (enumerating the order in which cities should be visited). For instance, if there are $5$ cities, then a candidate solution might be $[4, 1, 0, 2, 3]$ (assuming zero-indexing).\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of Evolutionary Computation approaches, a simple sequence representation can be used, coupled with mechanisms that ensure that the candidate solutions remain feasible during crossover and mutation. This can be accomplished by ad hoc genetic operators (which in the inspyred framework are dubbed as \"variators\"), namely the partially matched crossover and the inversion mutation, as shown in the next cell. As an alternative, we can use Ant Colony Optimization that is naturally suited for solving graph-like problems such as the TSP and, differently from Evolutionary Computation approaches, does not require any specific operator. To start the experiments run the next cell $^{[2]}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code will perform a single run of Ant Colony Systems (ACS) and a customized Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) and show you the fitness trends of both algorithms, as well as a map corresponding to the best solutions provided by the two algorithms. Note that for both algorithms the fitness function is defined as the reciprocal of the total distance traveled ($f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sum{d}}$), to be maximized, such that maximizing $f(x)$ corresponds to minimizing the total distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute the following cell on different problem instances (this can be obtained by changing the variable \"instance\" in the next cell) and observe the behavior of the two algorithms on each instance. Note that the run time can be quite long (several seconds)\n",
    "on larger instances (especially on *att48*). \n",

    "## Knapsack problem \n",
    "In the Knapsack problem $^{[1]}$, we are given a knapsack of fixed capacity $C$. We are also given a list of $N$ items, each having a weight $w$ and a value $v$. We can put any subset of the items into the knapsack, as long as the total weight of the selected items does not exceed $C$. In the most general formulation of the problem, it is possible to select the same item multiple times. We aim to maximize the total value of the selection, which is the sum of the values of each item we put into the knapsack. Thus, a solution of the Knapsack problem is a subset $S$ of the $N$ items, each considered a certain number of times, for which the total weight is less than or equal to $C$, and which maximizes the total value. If the same item can be selected multiple times, the problem is called *Knapsack with duplicates*, otherwise if any item can be selected only once, the problem is called *0/1 Knapsack*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Candidate solutions for the Knapsack problem can be represented as either a binary list (for the *0/1 Knapsack*) or as a list of non-negative integers (for the Knapsack with duplicates). In each case, the length of the list is the same as the number of items, and each element of the list corresponds to the quantity of the corresponding item to place in the knapsack. In case of Evolutionary Computation approaches, we can use as genetic operators uniform crossover and Gaussian mutation, as shown in the next cell. The reason we can use Gaussian mutation, even though the candidates are composed of discrete values, is because the bounder created by the Knapsack benchmark is an instance of $DiscreteBounder$, which automatically moves an illegal component to its nearest legal value (an integer, in this case). Once again, as an alternative we can use Ant Colony Optimization.\n",
    "In this exercise, we will focus on the *0/1 Knapsack problem* (this is obtained by setting duplicates=False in next cell). To start the experiments, you need to run the next cell. The script will perform a single run of Ant Colony Systems (ACS) and a customized Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) and show you the fitness trends of both algorithms.\n",
