    "## Goal.\n",
    "The goal of this lab is to perform some preliminary experiments aimed at understanding some advantages and pitfalls of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). In particular, you will observe the effects of mutations and problem dimensionality, and reflect to what extent these observations also apply to biological evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, unless otherwise specified, in this module's exercises we will use real-valued genotypes. \n",
    "I.e., an individual is a vector of real-valued parameters $\\mathbf{x} = \\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_N\\}$ (however, keep in mind that other types of individual representations are possible, such as trees or bit strings, which will not be explored in this lab). The fitness of an individual is given by the fitness function $f(\\mathbf{x})$. The aim of the algorithms will be to *minimize* the fitness function $f(\\mathbf{x})$, i.e. to find the vector $\\mathbf{x}_{min}$ that has the lowest value $f(\\mathbf{x})$. In other words, lower values $f(\\mathbf{x})$ correspond to a better fitness!"

    "# Exercise 1\n",
    "In this first exercise, we will not yet run a complete EA. Instead, we consider a single parent individual **$x_{0}$**, from which a number of offspring individuals are created using a Gaussian mutation operator (perturbe a point locally according to a Gaussain) (which adds a random number from a Gaussian distribution with mean zero and standard deviation $\\sigma$ to each parameter $x_i$ of the parent). The fitness function, shown in the figure below for $N=2$ variables, is defined as:\n",
    " \n",
    "$f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N}{x^2_i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "![sphere.png](img/sphere.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is usually defined to as *sphere* function $^{[1]}$ and is one of the most used benchmark functions in continuous (real-valued) optimization. This fitness function is unimodal, i.e. it has a single global minimum at the origin. Furthermore, this function is *scalable*, i.e. it can be defined for any arbitrary number of variables ($N=1, 2, 3, ...$, i.e. $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$).\n",
    "We will analyze the effects of mutations on the fitness depending on the value of the parent $\\mathbf{x}_0$, the mutation magnitude $^{[2]}$ (the standard deviation $\\sigma$), and the number of dimensions $N$ of the search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start the experiments, run the next cell $^{[3]}$. It willl generate offspring from a single parent $\\mathbf{x}_0$ using a Gaussian mutation operator (which adds a random number from a Gaussian distribution with mean zero and standard deviation $\\sigma$ to the parent). Generate offspring from different parents (e.g. $\\mathbf{x}_0$=0.1, 1, 10) using different mutation magnitudes (standard deviations $\\sigma$). First consider the one-dimensional case, then two dimensions, and finally many dimensions (e.g. $N =100$). For one or two dimensions, the fitness landscape with the parent and the offspring is shown. For more dimensions, a __[boxplot](http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html\\#matplotlib.pyplot.boxplot)__ if you are unfamiliar with boxplots with the fitness of the offspring is shown where the green, dashed line is the fitness of the parent (we want our perturbations to have a smaller fitness value than the parent).\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do the mutations tend to improve or worsen the fitness of the parent?\n",
    "- Are low or high mutation magnitudes best for improving the fitness? How does this depend on the initial value of the parent and on the number of dimensions of the search space?\n",

    "\n",
    "[1]: \n",
    "Note that its contour lines, i.e. the loci of points for which the function has a constant value, are $N$-dimensional *spheres* centered in **0**. For instance, in 2-D, the contour lines are curves described by $x^2_1+x^2_2=k$, which correspond to a circle (the equivalent of a sphere in 2 dimension) with radius $\\sqrt{k}$ and center in $\\{0,0\\}$. In 3-D, the contour lines are curves described by $x^2_1+x^2_2+x^2_3=k$, which correspond to a sphere with radius $\\sqrt{k}$ and center in $\\{0,0,0\\}$. For $N>3$, each contour line corresponds to a *hyper-sphere*, i.e. a generalization of a sphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "[2]: \n",
    "In the following, *mutation magnitude* indicates a generic measure of the mutation effect on the genotype. E.g. in continuous optimization with Gaussian mutation $x'=x+\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma$) the *mutation magnitude* is simply $\\sigma$. This is different from the *mutation probability*, that is the chance that a given loci would be mutated. The combination of these two aspects, magnitude and probability, may be considered the overall *mutation rate*.] \n",
